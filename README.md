## 🏗️ How It Works

### Overview

JURSM creates a complete revenue sharing infrastructure on top of Jupiter Ultra's trading engine. The system handles referral tracking, fee collection, and automated distribution through smart contracts on Solana.

### The Complete Flow

#### 1. **Referral Infrastructure Setup**
Platforms integrate JURSM to create a referral ecosystem:
- Generate unique referral identifiers for partners, influencers, or users
- Configure commission structures (e.g., 30% to referrer, 20% discount to user)
- Set up tracking parameters for analytics and attribution

#### 2. **Trade Initiation with Referral Tracking**
When a referred user initiates a trade:
- The referral link parameters are captured and validated
- Jupiter Ultra provides the swap quote with current market rates
- Platform fees are calculated and displayed transparently
- The fee structure shows exact distribution (referrer commission, user discount, platform revenue)

#### 3. **Escrow-Based Fee Management**
Upon trade confirmation:
- Platform fees are deposited into a program-derived address (PDA) escrow account
- The escrow stores the Jupiter quote parameters (input/output mints, amounts)
- Smart contracts enforce the predetermined fee distribution rules
- All parties can verify their expected earnings on-chain

#### 4. **Trade Execution & Verification**
The actual swap executes through Jupiter Ultra:
- User signs the transaction containing the swap instructions
- Jupiter's routing engine finds the optimal path across Solana DEXs
- JURSM monitors the transaction signature for completion
- Upon confirmation, the system verifies the swap matches the original quote parameters

#### 5. **Automated Revenue Distribution**
Once verified, the smart contract executes distribution:
- **Referrer Commission**: Automatically transferred to the referrer's account
- **User Rebate**: Returned to the trader as a referral discount
- **Platform Revenue**: Allocated to the platform's treasury
- **Partner Splits**: Any additional revenue sharing agreements are executed

All distributions happen atomically - either all succeed or none do.

#### 6. **Analytics & Reporting**
Real-time data flows to all stakeholders:
- **Referrers** access dashboards showing conversion rates, lifetime value, and earnings
- **Platforms** monitor overall volume, fee generation, and referrer performance
- **Users** track their trading history and referral savings
- **APIs** provide programmatic access to all metrics

### Key Components

**Smart Contract (Program)**: The on-chain logic that manages escrows, verifies trades, and distributes fees. Written in Rust/Anchor framework for security and efficiency.

**Escrow System**: Temporary holding accounts that ensure fees are only distributed after successful trade execution. Each trade creates a unique escrow PDA.

**Commission Vault**: A global account that aggregates referrer earnings, allowing batch claims and reducing transaction costs.

**Analytics Backend**: Off-chain service that indexes on-chain events, calculates metrics, and serves data to frontends via REST/GraphQL APIs.

**SDK**: TypeScript/JavaScript library that simplifies integration, handling transaction building, PDA derivation, and error management.

### Security & Trust

- **Non-custodial**: Platforms never hold user funds, only platform fees
- **Transparent**: All fee structures and distributions are visible on-chain
- **Atomic**: Distributions either complete fully or revert entirely
- **Permissionless**: Anyone can verify trade execution and fee distribution
